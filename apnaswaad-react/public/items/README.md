# Note: Missing Product Images

The following product images need to be added manually to `public/items/`:

1. **motichoor_laddoo.jpg** - Motichoor Laddoo image
2. **malai_peda.jpg** - Malai Peda image
3. **kalakand.jpg** - Kalakand image

These images will use placeholder images from the application until you add real product photos.

You can:
- Take photos of the actual products
- Use stock photos from royalty-free sites like Unsplash or Pexels
- Use AI image generators later when quota resets

The application is fully functional and will display placeholder images for missing photos.
